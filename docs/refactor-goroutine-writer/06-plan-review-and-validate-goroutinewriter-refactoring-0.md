I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

The goroutineWriter refactoring is successfully completed across all phases with excellent code quality, consistency, and backward compatibility. All writers follow appropriate patterns: synchronous writers (console, file) for fast I/O, async writers (logStore, context) using goroutineWriter base for non-blocking buffered processing, poll-based writer (websocket) for real-time streaming, and query-only writer (memory) for log retrieval. The README.md is comprehensive but lacks documentation of the new goroutineWriter architecture, async writer behavior, and updated performance characteristics. No code duplication remains beyond intentional patterns in synchronous writers. Performance is improved (contextWriter now non-blocking) with acceptable tradeoffs. Test coverage is excellent at ~95% with 30 comprehensive tests.

### Approach

Update README.md documentation to reflect the new goroutineWriter architecture, clarify writer types and patterns, and update performance characteristics. This is a documentation-only task with no code changes required. The updates will help future maintainers understand the architectural improvements and guide users on when to use each writer type.

### Reasoning

I completed a comprehensive review of all refactored writers (goroutineWriter, logStoreWriter, contextWriter, websocketWriter), verified consistency across implementations, confirmed no breaking changes to public APIs, analyzed code duplication patterns, assessed existing README.md documentation, and validated performance characteristics remain appropriate. The refactoring is complete and production-ready; only documentation updates remain.

## Proposed File Changes

### README.md(MODIFY)

References: 

- writers\goroutinewriter.go
- writers\logstorewriter.go
- writers\contextwriter.go
- writers\websocketwriter.go
- writers\consolewriter.go
- writers\filewriter.go

Add comprehensive documentation for the goroutineWriter architecture and async writer pattern to help users and maintainers understand the architectural improvements.

**Location 1: Update Features Section (After Line 53)**

Current text at line 44:
- **Multi-Writer Architecture**: Console, File, and Memory writers with shared log store

Update to:
- **Multi-Writer Architecture**: 
  - Synchronous writers (Console, File) for immediate output
  - Async writers (LogStore, Context) with buffered non-blocking processing
  - WebSocket writer for real-time streaming to connected clients
  - Shared log store for queryable in-memory and optional persistent storage

Add new feature bullet after line 53:
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking buffered writes with graceful shutdown and automatic buffer draining

**Rationale:** Clarifies the different writer types and their characteristics upfront, helping users choose the right writer for their use case.

**Location 2: Add New Section "Writer Architecture" (After Line 660, After "Design Principles" Section)**

Insert new section with approximately 60 lines documenting:

1. **Section header:** "Writer Architecture"

2. **Subsection: Synchronous Writers (Console, File)**
   - Pattern description: Direct write to output (stdout or file)
   - Performance: ~50-100μs per log entry
   - Blocking: Yes, but fast
   - Use cases: Development debugging, production file logging
   - Code example showing synchronous write behavior

3. **Subsection: Async Writers (LogStore, Context)**
   - Pattern description: Buffered channel + background goroutine processing
   - Performance: ~100μs non-blocking write + async processing
   - Blocking: No - returns immediately
   - Buffer capacity: 1000 entries per writer
   - Overflow behavior: Drops entries with warning log
   - Shutdown: Automatic buffer draining ensures no log loss
   - Code example showing async writer usage
   - ASCII diagram showing data flow:
     - Log Event → goroutineWriter Base (async, buffered)
     - LogStoreWriter → ILogStore → In-Memory/BoltDB
     - ContextWriter → Global Context Buffer → Channel
   - Benefits list:
     - Non-blocking writes prevent slow storage from blocking logging path
     - 1000-entry buffer absorbs traffic bursts
     - Graceful shutdown with automatic buffer draining prevents log loss
     - Level filtering applied before buffering for efficiency
     - Thread-safe concurrent writes with minimal lock contention

4. **Subsection: Poll-Based Writer (WebSocket)**
   - Pattern description: Polls ILogStore on timer, broadcasts to clients
   - Performance: Retrieves batches every 500ms (configurable)
   - Blocking: No
   - Use cases: Real-time log streaming to web clients
   - Code example showing WebSocket writer setup
   - Note explaining pull-based model vs push-based model

**Rationale:** Provides comprehensive documentation of the new architecture, explains the different patterns, helps users understand when to use each writer type, and documents the architectural decision to use different patterns for different use cases. The ASCII diagram visualizes the data flow clearly.

**Location 3: Update Performance Characteristics Section (Lines 458-464)**

Current text:
```
- **Console/File writes**: ~50-100μs (unchanged, fast path)
- **Memory store writes**: Non-blocking buffered (~100μs) + async persistence
- **Correlation queries**: ~50μs (in-memory map lookup)
- **Timestamp queries**: ~100μs (in-memory slice scan)
- **BoltDB persistence**: Async background writes (doesn't block logging)
```

Update to:
```
- **Synchronous writes (Console/File)**: ~50-100μs, blocking but fast
- **Async writes (LogStore/Context)**: ~100μs non-blocking + background processing
  - Buffer capacity: 1000 entries per writer
  - Overflow behavior: Drops entries with warning log
  - Shutdown: Automatic buffer draining prevents log loss
- **Correlation queries**: ~50μs (in-memory map lookup)
- **Timestamp queries**: ~100μs (in-memory slice scan)
- **BoltDB persistence**: Async background writes (doesn't block logging)
- **WebSocket polling**: Retrieves batches every 500ms (configurable)
```

**Rationale:** Clarifies the performance characteristics of async writers, documents buffer behavior, distinguishes between synchronous and asynchronous patterns, and adds WebSocket polling information.

**Location 4: Add Note to Memory Logging Section (After Line 356)**

Current text shows architecture with bullet points about fast in-memory storage, optional BoltDB persistence, non-blocking async writes, and automatic TTL cleanup.

Insert new bullet after "Non-blocking async writes" (around line 355):
- **Buffered async writes** - LogStoreWriter uses 1000-entry buffer for non-blocking writes with automatic overflow handling

**Rationale:** Informs users that memory writes are non-blocking and buffered, which is important for high-throughput scenarios and helps them understand the performance characteristics.

**Location 5: Add Note to Context-Specific Logging Section (After Line 223)**

Current text describes the 4-step process: Consumer Sets a Channel, Producers Log with Context, Additive Logging, Batching and Streaming.

Insert new step 5 after step 4 (after "Batching and Streaming" around line 223):
5. **Non-Blocking Writes**: The context logger uses an async buffered writer (1000-entry capacity) to prevent blocking on slow context buffer operations, ensuring your application remains responsive even under high logging load.

**Rationale:** Explains the performance benefit of the async pattern for context logging, helping users understand why context logging won't slow down their application.

**Summary of Documentation Changes:**
- Update Features section to clarify writer types (1 modification at line 44)
- Add new feature bullet for async processing (1 addition after line 53)
- Add comprehensive "Writer Architecture" section (1 new section, ~60 lines after line 660)
- Update Performance Characteristics section with async details (1 modification at lines 458-464)
- Add buffered async write note to Memory Logging section (1 addition after line 356)
- Add non-blocking write note to Context-Specific Logging section (1 addition after line 223)

**Total impact:** ~70 lines added, 5 sections updated, significantly improved architectural documentation without changing any existing code examples or usage patterns. All changes are additive and clarifying, maintaining backward compatibility with existing documentation.
